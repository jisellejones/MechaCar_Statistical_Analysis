# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help AutosRU (an imaginary company) identify variables in production are hindering the manufacturing team's progress in developing their newest prototype, the MechaCar. In this anlyasis, we review production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

The analysis consists of the following:
- Multiple linear regression to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- T-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- The design for a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers

## Deliverable 1: Multiple Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Questions
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - 
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

## Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
